        <p>A Cappuccino is one of the most popular coffee beverages in the world, known for its balanced combination of bold espresso, creamy steamed milk, and velvety milk foam. This Italian classic typically consists of three equal parts: one-third espresso, one-third steamed milk, and one-third foam. The result is a well-rounded drink that combines the strong, rich flavor of coffee with the smooth texture of milk.</p>
